### The Purpose
Our nutrition tracker is simple: you can collect, submit and analyze your food intake patterns
Amid all the meals, we fail to understand the amount of nutrition we consume daily. Protein, carbohydrates, fat, and calories have a specific impact on the human body. And to stay healthy, one should eat healthily. However, keeping track of the diet manually on either paper or digitally both have the same intention.

### Functionalities
* Track nutrition by user
* Add foods by searching them up
* Delete foods
* Adjust serving size of food entry
* Analyze the data in a graph/table format
